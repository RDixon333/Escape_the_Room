# Escape_the_Room

To keep myself from overcommitting to something I don't yet have the full grasp of, I've decided to make my project a little "Escape the Room" game. It would utilize my own internal database of virtual items.

The idea is that you are stuck in a room and need to escape. There are four actions: look, open, grab, use. They involve looking around the room, opening doors, grabbing items, and using them to progress the game.

Javascript will do most of the heavy lifting, while HTML and a small bit of CSS will make it somewhat appealing to look at.
