# Escape_the_Room

To keep myself from overcommitting to something I don't yet have the full grasp of, I've decided to make my project a little "Escape the Room" game. It would utilize my own internal database of virtual items.

The idea is that you are stuck in a room and need to escape. This will utilize HTML tables as the front end, and Javascript working in the backend, managing the state of interactive objects. There will be 4 interactive objects in the "room": a refrigerator, drawer, cabinet, and the locked door. You can click on objects, and they will change state, and/or return a message.

Javascript will do most of the heavy lifting, while HTML and a small bit of CSS will make it somewhat appealing to look at.
